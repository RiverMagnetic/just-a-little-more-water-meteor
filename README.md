## Just a Little More Water

I am learning Meteor and Blaze, and sharpening my JavaScript and MongoDB skills. As part of my learning process I am redoing my Just Add Water app using these technologies. Because I'm doing this in Meteor, all of the application files will be contained in this repo rather than split between a front-end repo and a back-end repo.

## Just Add Water

The original single page application is a gentle personal growth app, built for mobile use.

In that application users can sign up and create short journal entries. The app's resources are private to each user, so users can only create, read, update, and delete their own journal entries.

In Just a Little More Water I will recreate all of the current functionality of Just Add Water.

In future iterations users will also be able to set goals and note their progress towards those goals.

## Technologies Used

This project uses Javascript, MongoDB, Meteor, Blaze, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.


## Development Process for the Original App

I created tools to guide my development process, including Wireframes, User Stories, a Front-End Mock-Up, and an ERD. After the creating the mock-up I built the back end and tested the CRUD actions with curl scripts. Finally I added functionality and further styling to my Front End and linked it to the API I built.

In building the front-end, I learned more about Handlebars, Bootstrap, and JavaScript date objects, methods, and interpolation. When I ran into issues, I posted on the issue queue, as well as reached out to instructors, students in my cohort, and my growing network of more experienced software engineers.


## Set Up and Installation Instructions for the Original App

Going to the homepage and creating an account is all the set-up a general user needs to do to use this app. If you want to tinker with the app on your own computer, install dependencies using npm install, and run locally using 'PORT=7165 npm start' in conjunction with running the back end.


## Problems I Plan to Solve in Future Iterations

My main priority is to get the UI in good shape throughout the app. 

Additionally, I want to make the created-at dates for previous entries display nicely and continue to work on the styling, both for the look of the mobile version and proper display for the desktop version.
